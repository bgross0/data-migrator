## Enhanced Features

### 1. Better Error Handling
```python
# Before
except Exception as e:
    return {"error": str(e)}

# After
except httpx.ConnectError:
    return {"error": "Backend API not running on port 8888. Start with: uvicorn app.main:app --port 8888"}
```

### 2. Logging
- All tools now log their actions
- Configurable log level via `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` env var
- Helps debug issues

### 3. Caching Support
- TTL-based caching for frequently accessed data
- Reduces API calls
- Configurable via `MCP_CACHE_TTL`

### 4. Environment Configuration
```bash
# New environment variables
DATA_MIGRATOR_API=http://localhost:8888/api/v1  # API endpoint
MCP_LOG_LEVEL=INFO                               # Logging level
MCP_CACHE_TTL=300                                # Cache TTL in seconds
```

## Usage Examples

### Deep Data Analysis
```
User: "Analyze the quality of the email column in my customer sheet"

Claude: [Calls analyze_column_quality]
"The email column has:
- 15% null values (150 out of 1000 rows)
- 3 invalid formats: 'john@', '@company.com', 'not-an-email'
- 5 duplicates found
- Recommendation: Apply email_normalize transform and handle nulls"
```

### Error Debugging
```
User: "My last import failed. What went wrong?"

Claude: [Calls get_import_history]
        [Calls analyze_import_errors]
"Your import failed due to:
1. Missing required field 'name' (45 rows)
2. Invalid email formats (12 rows)
3. Duplicate customer codes (3 instances)

Suggested fixes:
- Map the 'customer_name' column to 'name' field
- Apply email_normalize transform
- Remove or merge duplicate records"
```

### Intelligent Mapping
```
User: "Help me map my spreadsheet to res.partner"

Claude: [Calls suggest_field_mapping]
"Based on analysis, here are my recommendations:
- 'customer_name' → 'name' (100% confidence - exact match)
- 'email_address' → 'email' (90% confidence - pattern match)
- 'phone_number' → 'phone' (80% confidence - apply phone_normalize)
- 'company' → 'company_name' (70% confidence - partial match)
```

### System Monitoring
```
User: "Is everything working properly?"

Claude: [Calls check_system_status]
"System Status:
✅ API: Healthy (v1.0.0)
✅ Database: Connected
⚠️ Odoo: Disconnected (check credentials)
✅ Storage: Available (2.3GB free)

Action needed: Configure Odoo connection in .env file"
```

## Benefits of Enhanced Visibility

1. **Proactive Problem Detection**
   - Claude can identify issues before they cause import failures
   - Suggests preventive measures

2. **Detailed Error Analysis**
   - No more cryptic error messages
   - Clear, actionable fix suggestions

3. **Data Quality Insights**
   - Understand data issues at column level
   - Get specific cleaning recommendations

4. **Intelligent Assistance**
   - AI-powered mapping suggestions
   - Context-aware help based on actual data

5. **System Transparency**
   - Full visibility into system health
   - Historical view of import operations

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Enhanced server with 20+ tools
- Added logging and error handling
- Implemented caching support
- Created documentation

🔄 **Next Steps:**

## Security Notes

All enhancements maintain the original security model:
- ✅ All tools remain read-only
- ✅ Sample limits enforced (max 20 rows)
- ✅ No access to sensitive data
- ✅ Local-only operation (stdio)

## For Developers

To add new tools:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def my_new_analysis_tool(param: str) -> dict:
    """Tool description for Claude."""
    logger.info(f"Running analysis for {param}")

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        try:
            response = await client.get(f"{BASE_URL}/my-endpoint")
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
        except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
            logger.error(f"HTTP error: {e}")
            return {"error": f"Failed: {e.response.status_code}"}
```

With these enhancements, Claude Code now has **deep visibility** into:
- Data quality and patterns
- Import history and errors
- System health and configuration
- Relationships and dependencies

This makes Claude Code a truly powerful assistant for Data Migrator users!
