# Matcher Validation Test Harness - Summary

## What Was Built

I've created a comprehensive testing and validation system for your field mapper that will help you:

1. **Validate** that the complex matcher actually works correctly
2. **Measure** which of the 8 strategies are effective vs noisy
3. **Optimize** strategy weights based on real data
4. **Prove** the system is robust before adding pre-cleaning and validation

## How It Works

### 1. Test Harness (`test_harness.py`)

**What it does:**
- Runs the field mapper against real test data
- Compares results to known "correct" answers (ground truth)
- Measures accuracy, precision, recall
- Shows which columns were mapped correctly/incorrectly
- Generates HTML, JSON, and CSV reports

**Example output:**
```
TEST: customers
Columns: 9
Ground truth mappings: 9

RESULTS SUMMARY
Total Columns:      9
  Mapped:           9
  Unmapped:         0

Accuracy Metrics:
  Correct:          8
  Incorrect:        1
  Missing:          0

  Accuracy:         88.9%
  Precision:        88.9%
  Recall:           88.9%

Strategy Performance:
  ExactNameMatch                 8/8 (100.0%)
  LabelMatch                     6/7 (85.7%)
  FuzzyMatch                     2/5 (40.0%)
```

### 2. Strategy Analyzer (`strategy_analyzer.py`)

**What it does:**
- Tests each of the 8 strategies in isolation
- Shows which strategies have high precision vs add noise
- Tests strategy combinations
- Recommends optimal weights

**Example output:**
```
INDIVIDUAL STRATEGY ANALYSIS

Testing strategy: ExactNameMatch
  Correct: 8/9 (88.9%)
  Precision: 100.0%
  Recall: 88.9%

Testing strategy: FuzzyMatch
  Correct: 3/9 (33.3%)
  Precision: 60.0%
  Recall: 33.3%

WEIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS

ExactNameMatch                 Weight: 1.0 - STRONG - Keep enabled
  Accuracy: 88.9%, Precision: 100.0%

LabelMatch                     Weight: 1.0 - STRONG - Keep enabled
  Accuracy: 77.8%, Precision: 87.5%

FuzzyMatch                     Weight: 0.0 - POOR - Disable
  Accuracy: 33.3%, Precision: 60.0%
```

### 3. Ground Truth Definitions (`ground_truth.py`)

Defines the "correct answer" for 10 test cases:
- Customers (res.partner)
- Products (product.product)
- Sales Orders (sale.order)
- Leads (crm.lead)
- Invoices (account.move)
- Projects (project.project)
- Tasks (project.task)
- Vehicles (fleet.vehicle)
- Sale Order Lines (sale.order.line)
- Financial Analysis (account.analytic.line)

Example:
```python
"customers": {
    "Customer Name": ("res.partner", "name"),
    "Contact Email": ("res.partner", "email"),
    "Phone": ("res.partner", "phone"),
    ...
}
```

## How to Run

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
cd /home/zlab/data-migrator/backend/tests/matcher_validation
./run_validation.sh
```

This runs everything and generates reports.

### Manual Steps

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (if needed)
pip3 install pandas networkx pygtrie openpyxl

# 2. Run test harness
python3 test_harness.py --verbose

# 3. Run strategy analyzer
python3 strategy_analyzer.py

# 4. View reports
ls -la reports/
# Open the HTML file in your browser
```

## What You'll Learn

After running the validation, you'll know:

1. **Does the complex matcher work?**
   - Overall accuracy across test cases
   - Which types of data it handles well
   - Where it struggles

2. **Which strategies are valuable?**
   - High-precision strategies to keep enabled
   - Noisy strategies to disable or reduce
   - Optimal weight configuration

3. **Where to focus improvements**
   - Columns that are frequently mis-mapped
   - Models that need better patterns
   - Edge cases to handle

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Run Validation (Today)

```bash
cd /home/zlab/data-migrator/backend/tests/matcher_validation
./run_validation.sh
```

Review the HTML report to see current performance.

### Step 2: Tune Strategy Weights (Based on Results)

Edit `backend/app/field_mapper/config/settings.py`:

```python
# Before tuning (default)
exact_match_weight: float = 1.0
label_match_weight: float = 0.95
fuzzy_match_weight: float = 0.65  # Might be causing issues

# After tuning (example based on hypothetical results)
exact_match_weight: float = 1.0   # Keep - high accuracy
label_match_weight: float = 0.95  # Keep - high accuracy
fuzzy_match_weight: float = 0.0   # Disable - low precision
```

### Step 3: Re-run Validation

After tuning weights, run validation again to confirm improvements:
```bash
./run_validation.sh
```

### Step 4: Add Pre-Cleaning (Once Matcher is Validated)

Only after the matcher is proven to work well:
- Add phone/email normalization
- Add date standardization
- Add name parsing

This ensures pre-cleaning helps rather than interfering with a broken matcher.

### Step 5: Add Validation Logic

Once matcher + pre-cleaning work well:
- MVS (Minimal Viable Sets) checking
- Orphan detection (missing parent records)
- Type validation (ensure data matches field types)

## Expected Results

Based on the sophisticated architecture you've built, I expect:

**High-performing strategies (≥80% accuracy):**
- ExactNameMatch
- LabelMatch
- SelectionValueMatch
- PatternMatch (for email, phone, etc.)

**Medium-performing strategies (60-80%):**
- DataTypeCompatibility
- ContextualMatch

**Potentially noisy strategies (<60%):**
- StatisticalSimilarity (might have too many false positives)
- FuzzyMatch (string similarity can be unreliable)

But we won't know for sure until we run the tests!

## Why This Approach is Better

Instead of blindly deleting the complex matcher OR blindly trusting it, we're:

1. **Measuring** actual performance with real data
2. **Identifying** which parts work vs which add noise
3. **Optimizing** based on evidence, not guesses
4. **Validating** improvements with re-testing

This is the scientific approach to building robust software.

## Questions?

If you have questions or want to add more test cases, the code is well-documented and extensible. Check the README.md for details.
