The field mapper is limited to ONLY these core modules:
- Sales & CRM
- Accounting & Finance
- Contacts & Partners
- Products & Inventory (basic)
- Purchase
- HR (basic)
- Projects
- Manufacturing (MRP)
- Website (basic)
- POS

It CANNOT map fields for:
- Fleet management data
- Maintenance/asset data
- Quality control data
- Event management
- Surveys/forms
- Helpdesk tickets
- Document management
- eLearning courses
- Appointments
- Field service
- Real estate
- Subscriptions
- And many more specialized modules

This is a SIGNIFICANT limitation for real-world usage.
